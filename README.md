# SU-Generator
This code generates the generator matrices for special unitary groups. The user specifies the degree and method.
There are two methods that can be employed in this code. One method is to construct the SU generators from subgroups. For example, building SU(5) from SU(3) and SU(2). The other method is to construct the generators by iteratively building off of SU(2). These methods' outcomes differ from one another.
